Hi, I'm a software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions. I am currently working as Conaultant for Reliance Industries.

I absolutely love to dive into complex coding challenges and finding efficient and elegant solutions. There's just something so satisfying about taking a problem that seems insurmountable and breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces. Once I have a better understanding of what needs to be done, I can start putting the pieces together and constructing a solution that is not only functional, but also scalable and maintainable. I find it incredibly rewarding to work through each step of the process, from initial planning to debugging and testing, and finally seeing my solution come to life.

# Projects

<u> **Microservices Architecture for Healthcare Platform** </u> - I worked on a project to migrate a monolithic healthcare platform to a microservices architecture. I developed several microservices using Spring Cloud and deployed them on AWS using Docker containers. I also implemented a messaging system using RabbitMQ to handle communication between microservices and ensure reliable data transfer.

**Data Analytics Platform** - I built a data analytics platform that collected, processed, and analyzed data from multiple sources. I utilized Apache Spark for data processing and Apache Cassandra for data storage. I also implemented a RESTful API for data retrieval and visualization using AngularJS.

**Inventory Management System** - I built an inventory management system for a manufacturing company that allowed for real-time tracking of products and raw materials. The system was built using Java, Spring, and Hibernate and utilized a MySQL database for data persistence. I also implemented a reporting module that generated various reports on inventory levels, product demand, and supply chain management.

**Payment Processing System** - I worked on a payment processing system that allowed customers to make payments securely using various payment methods. I utilized Java, Spring, and Hibernate to build the backend and integrated with a front-end system developed using React. The system was deployed on AWS and utilized AWS Lambda for serverless computing and AWS RDS for data storage.
