# Prashant Dhruw

Hi, I'm a software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions. I am currently working as Conaultant for Reliance Industries.

I absolutely love to dive into complex coding challenges and finding efficient and elegant solutions. There's just something so satisfying about taking a problem that seems insurmountable and breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces. Once I have a better understanding of what needs to be done, I can start putting the pieces together and constructing a solution that is not only functional, but also scalable and maintainable. I find it incredibly rewarding to work through each step of the process, from initial planning to debugging and testing, and finally seeing my solution come to life.

## **Projects**

***Microservices Architecture for Healthcare Platform***

•  **Technology Stack:** Java, Spring Cloud, AWS, Docker, RabbitMQ

•  I worked on a project to migrate a monolithic healthcare platform to a microservices architecture. This involved breaking down the monolithic application into smaller, loosely-coupled services that could be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

•  I developed several microservices using Spring Cloud and deployed them on AWS using Docker containers. This allowed for easier management of the services and improved scalability.

•  I implemented a messaging system using RabbitMQ to handle communication between microservices and ensure reliable data transfer. The messaging system acted as a buffer between microservices, allowing them to continue processing requests even if one or more services were unavailable.

***Data Analytics Platform***

•  **Technology Stack:** Java, Apache Spark, Apache Cassandra, AngularJS

•  I built a data analytics platform that collected, processed, and analyzed data from multiple sources. The platform was designed to handle large amounts of data and provide insights in real-time.

•  I utilized Apache Spark for data processing and Apache Cassandra for data storage. Apache Spark was used to process data in parallel across a cluster of nodes, while Cassandra was used to store the data in a highly-scalable and fault-tolerant manner.

•  I also implemented a RESTful API for data retrieval and visualization using AngularJS. The API allowed clients to retrieve data from the platform and display it in a variety of ways, such as charts, graphs, and tables.

***Inventory Management System***

•  **Technology Stack:** Java, Spring, Hibernate, MySQL

•  I built an inventory management system for a manufacturing company that allowed for real-time tracking of products and raw materials. The system was designed to help the company better manage their inventory and reduce waste.

•  The system was built using Java, Spring, and Hibernate and utilized a MySQL database for data persistence. This allowed for efficient storage and retrieval of inventory information.

•  I also implemented a reporting module that generated various reports on inventory levels, product demand, and supply chain management. These reports provided valuable insights into the company's operations and helped them make informed decisions.

***Payment Processing System***

• **Technology Stack:** Java, Spring, Hibernate, React, AWS, AWS Lambda, AWS RDS

•  I worked on a payment processing system that allowed customers to make payments securely using various payment methods. The system was designed to be fast, reliable, and secure to ensure a positive customer experience.

•  I utilized Java, Spring, and Hibernate to build the backend and integrated with a front-end system developed using React. This allowed for seamless communication between the backend and front-end systems.

•  The system was deployed on AWS and utilized AWS Lambda for serverless computing and AWS RDS for data storage. This ensured that the system could scale to meet increased demand and provided a cost-effective solution for data storage.
