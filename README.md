# Projects

**Microservices Architecture for Healthcare Platform** - I worked on a project to migrate a monolithic healthcare platform to a microservices architecture. I developed several microservices using Spring Cloud and deployed them on AWS using Docker containers. I also implemented a messaging system using RabbitMQ to handle communication between microservices and ensure reliable data transfer.

**Data Analytics Platform** - I built a data analytics platform that collected, processed, and analyzed data from multiple sources. I utilized Apache Spark for data processing and Apache Cassandra for data storage. I also implemented a RESTful API for data retrieval and visualization using AngularJS.

**Inventory Management System** - I built an inventory management system for a manufacturing company that allowed for real-time tracking of products and raw materials. The system was built using Java, Spring, and Hibernate and utilized a MySQL database for data persistence. I also implemented a reporting module that generated various reports on inventory levels, product demand, and supply chain management.

**Payment Processing System** - I worked on a payment processing system that allowed customers to make payments securely using various payment methods. I utilized Java, Spring, and Hibernate to build the backend and integrated with a front-end system developed using React. The system was deployed on AWS and utilized AWS Lambda for serverless computing and AWS RDS for data storage.
